# Journal

You will create and keep the process journal for the entire semester. The purpose of this journal is to track your own progress, have a closer look at your own process, reflect upon your own work so that we have a better understanding of ourselves and find a way to improve. 

You will update it regularly, at least once a week or more, throughout the semester. Find a way to organize your thoughts. (formats, posting frequency, time and days) 

1. Create an account on [Trello](http://trello.com) and make it public so your instructor and classmates can access.
1. You will also want to look at how Markdown formatting works. See [here](https://trello.com/c/JmIuOCpq/95-add-formatting-to-your-card-descriptions-using-markdown).
1. Document the course-related materials using text, image, videos, and/or links. 
1. Things you will include: 
  - inspirations you find,
  - research materials
  - sketches, 
  - screenshots of your workspace,
  - photos,
  - notes you create, 
  - prototypes, 
  - code snippets,
  - links to your code, 
  - summary of each class meeting,
  - questions you have,
  - discussions you have with classmates
1. Keep it professional. Only work-related postings.

After you create the Trello board, make it public (click on the lock icon), copy the URL and post the address on the Google drive document. Although your journal is publicly available, it is your own space, so feel free to use it the way you want.
