## Project: Interactive Type Poster design
- First, research on the filmmaker/films and develop visual concepts. You should be able to explain your concept next week when you present your idea.
- Find visual references and bring them back (images, websites, prints, etc.)
- Create two different mockups(ideas) for your poster using the template file: download [PSD](../files/web-poster-mockup-template.psd), [AI](../files/web-poster-mockup-template.ai). 
- You can go as tall as you need but keep the width 1200px.
- Remember that the final webpage will have movements and interactions. If necessary, design multiple mockups to show different states.
- Post the mockup file (PNG) on Google Drive.
