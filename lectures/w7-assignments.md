# Week 7 assignments

Continue working for your interactive poster project. This week, refine your design and start coding in html/css. Bring in the work-in-progress next class so we can work on problem-solving.

## Code Examples

- http://codepen.io/cdaein/pen/wJMjyw?editors=1100 - this example shows you how an element can trigger animation of another element.
- `display: none;` vs. `visibility: hidden` - display set to none will completely remove the element, whereas visibility set to hidden will hide the element but it will still take up the space. look at [the reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_visibility.asp).
