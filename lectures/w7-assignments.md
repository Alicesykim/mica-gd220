## Project: Interactive Poster design
- Create a mockup for your poster using the template file: download [PSD](../files/web-poster-mockup-template.psd), [AI](../files/web-poster-mockup-template.ai)
- Although you will only present the mockup design next week, do follow other steps such as researching, mood boards, sketching, etc.
- You can make the design as long as you want. Just extend the size.
- Remember that the final webpage will be interactive. Although we cannot show any movements on PSD/AI, you should develop ideas for animation and interaction.
- Post the mockup file (PNG file) on Google Drive.
