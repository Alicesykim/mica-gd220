# Week 7 assignments

Poster design deadline has been extended. This week, refine your design and coding, and bring in the work-in-progress next class so we can work on problem-solving.

## Examples

- http://codepen.io/cdaein/pen/wJMjyw?editors=1100 - this example shows you how an element can trigger animation of another element.
- `display: none;` vs. `visibility: hidden` - display set to none will completely remove the element, whereas visibility set to hidden will hide the element but it will still take up the space. look at [the reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_visibility.asp).
