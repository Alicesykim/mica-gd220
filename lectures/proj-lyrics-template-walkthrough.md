# Project 1 Template Walkthrough

For the Lyrical Mapping project, you will build upon a CSS template provided. **Do not start from scratch. Use the template folder and files provided.** This template includes many helpful classes to convert photoshop mockup to HTML/CSS codes.

## Overview
Download [HTML/CSS template project folder](../../files/proj1-template.zip) and unzip to your prefered location. The `p1-template` folder will be created. Change the folder name to your name as in `john-doe`. Do not have spaces in folder name and file names.

In the folder, you will see `index.html` file, `images` folder and `css` folder. `index.html` is the file you will add your own code. `images` folder is where you will place your image files (image slices from Photoshop mockup). `css` folder contains 2 files --- `reset.css` and `style.css`. `reset.css` is taken from [here](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). It resets all the CSS properties so that it will reduce browser inconsistencies and you can build your own design from a clean sheet.`style.css` contains the template codes and DO NOT edit this file. *You don't need to change anything from the reset.css and style.css.* 

Let's open up the project in Brackets. To open up a Brackets project, you don't double-click a file. Instead, drag and drop the entire folder to Brackets.

## Index file
`index.html` contains the minimal HTML setup. This is where you will write your own HTML and CSS codes. Change the `<title>` to the song title you are working on. 

```html
<title>Safe and Sound</title>
```

Right after the title is two `<link>` tags.	

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reset.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```
This is how you link the external css files to your html page. You could directly place all the css rules within the html page, but it is harder to manage, especially if you have multiple html pages.

The order of linking stylesheets are also important. In this case, we load `reset.css` first so that all the properties are reset, and on top of that, we add `style.css` to override with the template. After that you will write your own css within `<style>` block. Again, that will override any existing styles.

```html
<body>
 
  <div class="container">
    <!-- YOUR HTML CODE HERE -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-25 quarter test"></div>
      <div class="col-offset-25 col-25 quarter test"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
</body>
```

In the `<body>`, there are a few `<div>`s already setup. You can safely delete all these. Here are a few rules that you must follow in order for the template to work properly. 

- All your contents must go inside the `.container`. `.container` sets the width of the whole page dynamically. It responds to different screen sizes.
- Use `.row` for a group of horizontal columns. Anytime you want to move to the next row, create another div with the `.row` class.
- Inside each `.row`, create `div`s with proper classes that contain your text and/or images.
- All your contents must be marked up with HTML elements such as `div`, `h1`, `h2`, `p`, etc. Do not leave any text without markups.


## Template Styles
`style.css` contains a few useful class definitions to help your design. Do not change anything in this file. Instead, write your own CSS rules in `<style>` tag in `index.html` file.

### .container
```css
.container {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
`.container` has the margin of `0 auto`. The first `0` means that there are no top/bottom margins. `auto` means that left and right margins will be automatically calculated, and because both left and right are set to `auto`, they will be equal. This is a trick used to horizontally center any elements on a page.

`width: 100%;` sets the width of `.container` same as its containing element, `body`. So, the width of `.container` is the same as the entire page width.

`overflow: hidden` will hide any part of the elements that go out of `.container`.

### div
```css
div {
    width: 100%;
    float: left;
    position: relative;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
`div` is set to take up the 100% of its containing element, which is `.container`. But, we will override this rule later so that we can use smaller columns.

`div` is a block level element, therefore, it takes up the entire width available by default and pushes down any elements come after it. by using `float: left`, `div` will be floated to the left so that any remaining space can be used by an element that comes after it. This technique is used to create multi-column layouts.

`box-sizing: border-box` will make sure that any border added to `div` will not increase the overall box size, which is a default behavior of `div`. Instead, borders will be placed inside the box.

### column width
```css
/*  width */
div.col-25 { width: 25%; }
div.col-50 { width: 50%; }
div.col-75 { width: 75%; }
div.col-100 { width: 100%; }
```
The template is based on four column grid. Use these four classes to set the width of each column in your HTML.

### column offset width
```css
/* offset */
div.col-offset-25 { margin-left: 25%; }
div.col-offset-50 { margin-left: 50%; }
div.col-offset-75 { margin-left: 75%; }
div.col-offset-100 { margin-left: 100%; } 
```
These classes can be used as a spacer in your grid. For instance, `<div class="col-offset-25 col-25 quarter"></div>` will create a small square with 25% space before it.

### column height
```css
/* height */
div.full { padding-top: 100%; }
div.half { padding-top: 50%; }
div.quarter { padding-top: 25%; }
```
Add these classes to your `div` to determine the height. For instance,
`<div class="col-50 half"></div>` will create a 50% width square block.

### Helper classes
```css
/* to see the box */
.test { border: 1px solid red; }
```
You can temporarily add `.test` to see how big the box is for each element. This is useful for finding problems.

```css
/* center horizontally */
.center-h {
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}
/* center vertically */
.center-v {
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
}
```
Use `.center-h` and `.center-v` to center text elements horizontally and vertically. Use them with text elements such as `h1`, `h2`, `p`, etc.

```css
/* how much to push down (in percentage) */
.top-10 { top: 10%; }
.top-20 { top: 20%; }
.top-30 { top: 30%; }
...
.top-90 { top: 90%; }
.top-100 { top: 100%; }
```
`.top-**` classes will help you find the vertical position of text elements. Because of how the text is positioned and everything is calculated using percentages, these ten classes may not be enough to position the way you want. You can always create your own classes for more control.

<!--
## Nesting divs
For a complex layout, you may nest `div` within another `div`. The containing or parent `div` should not have the height. So do not use the classes like `.full`, `.half` or `.quarter` on the containing/parent element. The height will be determined by the children elements.
-->


## Add Your Own Styles
Now, come back to `index.html`, and write your own codes. Feel free to use the classes provided in `style.css` and write your own CSS rules as well.

A few things to remember.

- **Use relative units only.** Do not use `px` unit. `px` unit works great for a fixed layout, but it will not respond nicely to different screen sizes. Use `%` for column size and `vw` for font size.
- **Everything must be placed within `.container`.** No element should be placed outside `.container`.
- **Begin each row with `.row`.** The height of each row can be different depending on how tall columns are within the row.

## Think about the structure
One of the goals of this exercise is to get familiar with working with HTML/CSS structure. Before you start writing your code, look at your mockup layout and think about how you want to divide into columns and elements. Come up with the structure that makes it easy and flexible to work with.

## Create Your Own Classes
The classes that come with the CSS template are not enough to finish your design. You will have to create your own class rules for each column and each text element. It is a good practice to name your Photoshop mockup layers properly to match the names in your CSS.

## Image placement
To make the text and image work together nicely, we will use `background-image` CSS property instead of `img` HTML element. To give you an example of how it works.

```html
<style>
	.img-flower {
		background-image: url(/images/flower.png);
		background-size: cover;
	}
</style>
```

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-50 half img-flower"></div>
	</div>
</div>
```

As you can see from above, we do not place image directly in the HTML page, instead, we place the image as a background using CSS. Setting the size to `cover` will make sure the image will take up the entire space available.
