## Project 1 mockup design
This week, you will design the Photoshop mockup for your Lyrical Mapping project.

1. Read [the project brief](proj-lyrical-mapping.md) carefully.
1. Choose the song.
1. Collect images/graphics and create a [mood board](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/02/10/mood-boarding-methods-for-web-designers/) in class. This can be simply a collection of images on Illustrator artboards. The mood board is to develop ideas and get the inspirations. Images you collected for the board may or may not be part of your contents. *Collect at least 20 different images for your mood board.*
1. Use the provided [Project 1 PSD template](../files/proj1-psd-mockup-template.psd) to layout text and images.
1. The template is set at 1200px width/4200px height, and 4 column grids. -- you *have to* use these settings.
1. Each content (text and image) must fit into the given column sizes. (We will later cut them out and place them into our webpage.
1. After you finish creating the mockup, post the original file (PSD) on Google Drive Week 3 folder.

### Using the PSD template
There is a *text folder* in the layer setup. All the text layers you create will go into this layer folder. All the images should be placed outside this folder. Keep the multiple layers - do not merge them unless you have to. If you need to go taller, increase the *canvas size* by the multiple of 300 pixels, and set the *guides* properly.
