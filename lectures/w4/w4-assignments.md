# Week 4 assignments

- Improve your design mockup based on feedbacks from class. 
- Restructure your mockup so that it works better with the template.
- Watch the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gj_Dm_05Qg&feature=youtu.be) on using the HTML/CSS template. Follow along.
- From you PSD mockup, cut images(only images, hide the text) into slices and start laying down as `background-image` in css. Each image should have its own class.
```css
.img-flower {
  background-image: url(/images/img-flower.png);
  background-size: cover;
}

.img-ocean {
  background-image: url(/images/img-ocean.png);
  background-size: cover;
}
```
- Be clear and descriptive with your class names as well as image file names.

## Deliverables
