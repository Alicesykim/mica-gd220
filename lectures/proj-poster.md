# Project 2: Poster design for the web
You will design a poster for the retrospective of your favorite filmmaker. Pick five films directed by the filmmaker based on the criteria you set. This poster is supposed to live on the web. How is it similar to and different from the printed poster design? What possibilities and limitations do you have? What visual language will you use to represent the filmmaker's body of work? How do you relate the contents, form and interactions? Experiment with the medium and technologies. Use the technologies to create and control meanings, not just to show off the skills.

### Things to include in your poster
- The title of the show (you will come up with this.)
- The name of the filmmaker
- Location: The Charles Theatre, 1711 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201
- Website: http://thecharles.com/
- Date: March 10th ~ March 14th
- The information on five different film screenings: for each film, include the title and screening date/time

### Requirements
- Use type + image (photo, graphics, illustration, etc.)
- Use the template provided. Learn more about the template [here](http://j4n.co/blog/Creating-your-own-css-grid-system).
- Base your design on 1200 pixel width.
- Use `:hover`, `animation` and `transition` to create more engaging experience.
- **Do not use** the images of the filmmaker or performers in the films.
- Don't be *literal* with your design! For example, showing a screenshot from each film - too literal. Add your interpretation of the filmmaker.
