# Week 10 assignments

## Tutorial for everyone
This week, teach yourself a new technique in web design. Watch/read other tutorials online, play and experiment with them. If you had some exciting ideas to try out, now is the best time. First, make the technique yours. Try to understand everything going on. Do more research as necessary. Find something we havenâ€™t discussed in class. Once you understand the technique, think about the context - how/where it can be used. Make a tutorial to share with the whole class.

- Find something exciting and useful to many people.
- Your tutorial should take no more than 10-15 minutes to follow.
- Create a new card on Trello and post your tutorial. Be sure to format the text - regular text, headings, codes. (read [this posting](http://help.trello.com/article/821-using-markdown-in-trello))
- You may also use images.
- Alternatively, you may record a video tutorial.

We will have time to try your tutorials next week.
