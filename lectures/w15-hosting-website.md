# Hosting Your Website

We've been working on websites in class, but they only work inside your computer. To be able to publish your website so that anybody can visit your website, you will need to find a company to *host* your website. You can also host your website from your computer, but then you will need to keep it on 24/7.

## What you need
You basically need two things - domain hosting and web hosting. The domain hosting is to get your own url such as facebook.com or wikipedia.org. The web hosting is a server space where you can store your files such as html, css, images, etc.

There are plenty of companies who do both so you will need to take some time to shop around. Some companies offer free hosting services, too, although they may have some limitations (what's free usually isn't really free.)

You can also just get your domain name and link to your existing website/blog. For instance, you can buy *my-great-website.com* address and when people visit the website, link it to your instagram page or tumblr page. Then, later, when you have your own website design ready, you can simply change the link to the new webpages.

## Github Pages
This course website is hosted on Github Pages. Check this page out - https://pages.github.com It's a free service and we will use it to set up your website in this posting.

Follow these steps:

1. Sign up on http://github.com - Your username will become part of your website address. (i.e. http://your-user-name.github.io)
2. Download Github client for your OS from https://desktop.github.com
3. Create a new repository or repo. 
  - Name it exactly like this - yourusername.github.io
  - Set it Public.
  - Check the button: Initialize with README.
4. Open Github Desktop application.
5. Sign into your account in the app. (use the same email address you used to sign up.)
6. Hit the `+` sign and clone the repo you created.
7. It will ask you where to clone the repo. It's best that you keep it in your Documents folder. This repo will become a folder. All the changes you made to the files inside this folder will be synced with the web. So, choose your location wisely.
8. Now, go to your folder from Finder/Explorer.
9. This folder *is* your website. You can add html, css and other files here.
10. Let's make a quick `index.html` file in the folder.
11. Come back to Github Desktop. Look at the top of the window, and you will see *1 Uncommitted Change*.
12. Add a summary, and click on Commit to Master. 
13. Clink on Sync (or Publish if it's first time).
14. Now, visit the url - http://your-username.github.io


## Updating your content
After this initial setup, you will simply work on your webpage files and save them in the repo folder. When you are ready to publish again, open up Github Dekstop app, commit and sync.
