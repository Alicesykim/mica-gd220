# Project: Collections

Curate a collection of your own artifacts or things. This could take many forms - for examples, everything you are carrying in your bag, things that you have kept for years, things that you use everyday, things that you valu things that you own but hate, etc.

Collections often help us understand or make sense of things in the world. Tell a story about yourself, your interests, or your experiences through this set of things.

The things can act as literal representations or as metaphor or both.

Come up with an interesting way to tell/communicate your story to your audience. What kinds of visual languages will be effective, both denotatively and connotatively (ex. composition, typography, color, image, illustration, etc.) ?

With this project, we will practice content selection/creation, organizing information using typography and composition.

## Requirements
- Use both type and image.
- Do not use hand-written typefaces for this project.
- You may only choose one type family. So choose carefully - how many different weights are you going to need? Is it available as a web font? - and choose something that relates to your content.
- Include text on your page. The text can be found or written by you.

The things in your collection must be actual objects, so a collection of quotes for example will not work for this assignment (unless, I suppose, they are all represented in physical books)
