# Display vs. Visibility

## Display
```css

```

## Visibility
`display` and `visibility` are different. `display` will completely remove your element from a page whilie `visibility` will only make it transparent so that it will still take up the space.

## Opacity
`opacity` works like `visibility`. What is nice about it is that you can animate it - fading in or out.
