## Poster design for the web
For the next two weeks, we will work on a mini-project.

You will design a poster for the retrospective of your favorite filmmaker. Pick five films directed by the filmmaker based on the criteria you set. This poster is supposed to live on the web. How is it similar to and different from the printed poster design? What possibilities and limitations do you have? How do you relate the contents, form and interactions? Experiement with the medium and technologies. Use the technologies to create and control meanings, not just to show off the skills.

### Things to include in your poster
- The title of the show (you will come up with this.)
- The name of the filmmaker
- Location: The Charles Theatre, 1711 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201
- Website: http://thecharles.com/
- Date: March 10th ~ March 14th
- The information on five different film screenings: for each film, title and screening date(a film each day) / time(7pm)

### Requirements
- Use type + image (photo, graphics, illustration, etc.)
- Use the template provided. The template is based on [this posting](http://j4n.co/blog/Creating-your-own-css-grid-system).
- Base your design on 1200 pixel width. (We don't do the responvisve design this time)
- Use `:hover`, `animation` and `transition` to create more engaging experience.
- Do not use the images of the filmmaker or performers.
- Don't be *literal* with your design! For example, showing a screenshot from each film - too literal. Add your interpretation of the filmmaker.

### Things to do this week
- Create a mockup for your poster using the template file: download [PSD](../../files/web-poster-mockup-template.psd), [AI](../../files/web-poster-mockup-template.ai)
- Post the mockup file on Google Drive Week 6 folder. *If you work with AI, export to PDF.*
- Download the coding template [here](../../files/web-poster-code-template.zip) and start playing with it. *You will do the majority of the coding next week.*
