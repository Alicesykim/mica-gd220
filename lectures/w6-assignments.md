# Week 6 assignments

- Finish the Lyrical Mapping project.
- Make sure you are using relative units such as `%` or `vw` instead of `px`. You can test if you are doing it right or wrong by resizing your browser window. Everything(text, image, etc.) should scale up or down accordingly.
- Clean up and organize your code - comments, indents, proper line breaks, etc.
- Double check your images are properly stored in `images` folder and properly linked in your CSS.
- Test, test, test!!! Run your webpage using Chrome browser before submitting. Test on multiple computers, not just your own.
- Just because it worked on your machine does not mean it will work on other people's computers.

## Deliverables
- The html page name should be kept `index.html`
- Upload the entire project folder on Google Drive.
