# Week 10 assignments

## Tutorial for everyone
This week, teach yourself a new technique in web design. Watch/read other tutorials online, play and experiment with them. If you wanted to try some exciting ideas, now is the best time. First, make the technique yours (instead of just copying and pasting other people's work). Try to understand everything going on. Do more research as necessary. *Find something we havenâ€™t discussed in class.* Once you understand the technique, think about the context - how/where it can be used. Make a tutorial to share with the whole class.

- Find something exciting and useful to you and your classmates.
- Instead of just showing off a technique, provide a context - where and how can this technique be used? Provide an example.
- Create a Google document (or PDF file).
- You may also use images.
- Alternatively, you may record a video tutorial.
- Your tutorial should take no more than 10-15 minutes to follow.

We will have time to try your tutorials next week.
