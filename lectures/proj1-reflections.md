# Project 1 reflections

Go to your Trello journal. Create a card under Week 6. Project 1 reflection. Take some time and reflect on your own work. Comment on these areas:

- What do you think was most successful in your project?
- What do you think was weak in your project?
- What would you do if you had more time to work?
- What was the biggest issue you had while working on this project? And how did/would you handle it?
- Any other notes to yourself?
