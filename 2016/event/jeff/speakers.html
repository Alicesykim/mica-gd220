                    Detroit has changed dramatically since the mid-1900s and the policies and regulations used to guide development in the City require similar change to acknowledge a smaller population, prepare for a larger economy, and incorporate new, innovative land uses. The Master Plan of Policies needs to be updated to elevate its status and utility.

                    <p>IN 1999 STEPHEN POWERS stopped writing graffiti and tending bar to dedicate himself to being a full-time artist.  In spite of early spite. His work has been shown at Venice and Liverpool Biennials, as well as numerous shows at Deitch Projects. Powers was a Fulbright scholar in 2007. He used the grant to paint in the streets of Dublin and Belfast. His work in Belfast’s Lower Shankill area was inspired by the area’s political murals; Powers told the New York Times that he was “taking the form of the murals, which are powerful for all the wrong reasons, and trying to retain some of the power and use it in <br>a really good way.”<br><br></p>

                    SThe Connective Corridor is a collaboration
                    between Syracuse University, the City of
                    Syracuse and Onondaga County to connect
                    University Hill with downtown Syracuse.
                    The project includes new streetscapes
                    to make the city more pedestrian and
                    bike-friendly, a free public transportation
                    system with smart bus technology, and a
                    network of green infrastructure.
