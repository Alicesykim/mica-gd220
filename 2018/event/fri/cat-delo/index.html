            <p class="about-text">Graphic desgin has a direct impact on our culture and society. It is the designer's responsibility to use this power to influence change within the world. The promotion of sustainability has increasingly gained awareness in the design community, but are we as designers are overlooking a major detail in our strive for an eco-friendly cuture: the design process.</p>
            <p class="about-text">"Reduce Reuse Redesign" is a three day event dedicated to educating graphic designers about the importance of environmentally friendly design methods and how they can implemented in their own process. Featuring lectures delivered by experts of the field and and an endless amount of resources, Reduce Reuse Recycle will aims to help graphic designers to be ecologically aware and responsible in their own professional practices. From there, we hope these standards and ideas will inspire designers to output work that will inform the public about sustainability. Perhaps eco-friendly practices will become normalized into our culture and help improve this planet we call home. </p>
