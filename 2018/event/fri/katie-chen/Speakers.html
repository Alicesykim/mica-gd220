Her art combines her Swiss design training with West Coast postmodernism.</p>

                <p align="left">Charles "Chip" Kidd (born 1964) is an American graphic designer, best known for his book covers. Based in New York city, Kidd has become one of the most famous book cover designers to date. <br> According to Graphic Design: American Two, he has been credited with “helping to spawn a revolution in the art of America book packaging in the last ten years.” <br> One of the most consistent characteristics of Kidd’s style is the fact that his book covers don’t carry one signature look, as he states: “A signature look is crippling… the simplest and effective solutions aren’t dictated by style.”</p>
