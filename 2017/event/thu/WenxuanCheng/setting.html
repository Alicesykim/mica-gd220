Web designers are possessed by the fact that they can develop a website that works fluidly across multiple platforms.  Clients, on the other hand, also celebrate the ability to tap customers across devices. However, there has been a new approach that has been catching everyone’s fancy in the recent times.  It is called Adaptive Web Design.  We will talk about which approach works best for you.</td>

It's therefore better, the (flawed) argument goes, to serve the full site to everybody, including mobile users.</td>

Our sites can be viewed on any size screen, at any time, and responsive design is one approach that lets us accommodate the web’s variable shape. But with all of the challenges we’re facing and those yet to come, we need to begin building not just patterns, but principles for responsive design—principles that will allow us to focus not just on layout, but on the quality of our work.</td>

Strategies for how to approach, design and build an effective design system<br>
How to successfully maintain the system to ensure ongoing usefulness<br>

(Concise text contains less information to process; scannable text calls attention to key information; and questioning the credibility of promotional statements seems to distract users from processing the meaning, our earlier studies showed.) Thus, our aim was to rework existing Web pages so that they would minimize cognitive load and enhance speed and efficiency.</td>

In this talk, we will share our own perspectives (and reservations) on how adaptive content is being used today. We’ll discuss how adaptive content supports targeting content to device type—and why that’s rarely necessary. We’ll also describe ways that adaptive content can support tailoring content according to context—and ways that can go wrong. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of when adaptive content is necessary and how to get the most value from it.</td>
