For the majority of recent history it has kept close company with PR and corporate interest, used as a means for consolidating wealth in the hands of big business and reinforcing certain structures and world views. Possible Worlds approaches design as a means of skeptical optimism - a force that has the power to question and change political, economic and cultural conditions. <br><br>
      Possible Worlds presents the idea that design, by reflecting on itself as a discipline, can identify this power an redirect it as a tool for questioning these structures and building better futures. How can we find a balance between criticism and optimistic, deconstruction and imagination? Where can these two things meet? How can we use evolving media consciously and critically in a way that creates possible worlds and better futures.</div></div>
