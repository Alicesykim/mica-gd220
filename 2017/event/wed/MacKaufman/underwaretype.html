     	<div class="underwaretext">
     		<p>Zealotry wouldn’t be an inappropriate collective noun for Underware. They not only design<br> typefaces, they live type—they educate about type, they publish about type, they talk about <br> type, they want (and organise) others to talk about type.<br> 
     				<br> 
						There is an inherent honesty to their enthusiasm that betrays no snobbery—they simply think<br>  that type is very interesting and that everyone, given the chance, might think so too. Their<br>  work is among the most popular of independent type foundries — happy-go-lucky, high-qual-<br> ity, text-friendly typefaces for both display use and comprehensive typesetting. Underware’s<br>  typefaces stand out thanks to unique aesthetics, finished quality, and a considered collective <br> presence. Underware is a refreshing and intelligent type foundry who, while taking what they <br>  do seriously, manage to not take themselves too seriously.</p>

      	<p>The type foundry Underware was <br> founded in 1999 by Akiem Helmling, <br> Bas Jacobs and Sami Kortemäki, and <br> is based in Den Haag, Amsterdam <br> and Helsinki. Stay tuned, follow us on Twitter <br> or sporadically receive marvelous news<br> by our email newsletter.</p>
