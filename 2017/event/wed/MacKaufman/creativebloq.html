            	<p>Collaboration is at the very heart of the creative industries. Digital design studios unite front-end pixel shifters with back-end<br> code writers. Image agencies draw together photographers, art directors and lighting engineers. Even on the smallest of <br> print projects, a designer and printer will share a cup of coffee and discuss the most effective use of their skill sets in order to <br> produce the best work possible.<br> 
<br> 
Yet collaborative projects are not just about uniting necessary skills in order to get a job done. Over so many years we’ve <br> witnessed groundbreaking collaborative campaigns that merged mutually exclusive skills because collaboration ignites <br> creativity. And it’s in collaborative projects that much of the most astounding new creative work is to be found. “Collaboration<br>  is about allowing yourself to become contaminated with other people’s ideas and visions,” enthuses Bruno Sellés of Barce-<br> lona-based studio Vasava. “It’s about getting involved in work that forces you to think and act differently. It’s those unpredict-<br> able ideas that are the product of different takes on a common project. Sometimes it takes that clash of personalities, styles or <br> attitudes to come out with something new. Collaborative projects are great playgrounds to get out of your comfort zone and <br>  try new things. It’s exciting.”<br> 
<br> 
The creative director of design studio Popular, Peter Chadwick echoes this sentiment. As a designer, Chadwick has produced <br> record sleeve designs over the past 20 years for the likes of Primal Scream, Grace Jones and Girls Aloud amongst many oth-<br> ers, and is associate lecturer at Chelsea School of Art. He’s just completed the Desktop Publishing project – a fully functioning<br>  CMYK poster-printing table made in partnership with no fewer than nine fellow collaborators. For him, collaboration is about <br> creativity beyond his own, and the enjoyment he finds in working with other creatives.</p>

            “It challenges me to think in a different way every time I collaborate with <br>  another creative,” says Chadwick. “A different set of questions will always <br> arise when working with someone new, and another point of view from an-<br> other person is always welcome and revealing on a live project. We work in <br> an opinions-based industry – everyone’s will differ in some way, and that in<br>  itself is a challenge. If the collaboration is effective, all parties will be able to <br> bring a different set of skills and points of view to bear that will work harmo-<br> niously together. Collaborating also gives me the opportunity to work with a <br> wide range of talented, inspirational and like-minded creatives. I have a list<br>  of who I would like to collaborate with. Suffice to say the list is long, and gets <br> added to on a weekly basis.”</p>
