      		Welcome to <strong>SHAKE AND CREATE!</strong><br>
      		 <br>
      		This is an event brought to you buy graphic design sponsors all over the East Coast in attempt to pull together artists such <br> as design directors, senior designers and junior designers in order to create the “perfect team”. While offering a chance for<br> different artists’ styles to come together, the goal is for everyone to build a relationship in hopes to collaborate together in the  <br> near future.

							<br>
					Mac Kaufman, a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art, found<br> 
     			that as a young person in the Graphic Design department she wasn’t <br>
     			given the chance to collaborate with other artists in her department. <br>
     			Assignment after assignment all we’re given is the option to work alone <br> 
     			while our professors seemed to forget the concept of learning from <br>
     			others. We are as people are always growing and especially as impres<br>
     			sionable individuals, it is now that we can are given the opportunity to <br> 
     			learn and benefit from working together.</p>
