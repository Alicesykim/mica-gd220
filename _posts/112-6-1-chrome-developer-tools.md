### View Source
You can see the HTML source code and how a webpage is structured. It may not be easy to read because we don't always write HTML pages one by one. Often, the pages are dynamically created and there may be a lot of extra codes added by the server-side softwares. Sometimes, the codes are optimized for machines to read or people want to protect their source codes and make it cryptic.

### View Console
This is to interact with your browser using JavaScript codes.

### Inspect
If you wonder how an html element is structured and styled, simply right-click on the elemnt and choose `Inspect`. It will show you the page structure as well as all the styles that are applied to that element.

You can even add your own style to any webpage. All the custom styles you added will disappear when you refresh the page.
