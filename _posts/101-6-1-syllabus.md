## Grading
There will be 3 main projects(90%) and additional assignments(10%) related to each project. *The assignments and projects are subject to change.* The final grades will be based on all projects/assignments, not only the final result but also the whole process throughout the semester.

On any assignment, 

“A” is given to a student who has gone beyond expectations.  
“B” is given to a student with above-average work.  
“C” means that a student meets the requirements for the assignment.  
“D” shows that a student has not met the expectations.   
“F” means a student failed to submit the assignment or has shown very little effort.

All projects are due at the beginning of class. Work handed in more than 15 minutes after the beginning of class is marked late. Grades for late projects will be lowered a whole letter. After a full week, a project may not be handed in late and it will be awarded a failing grade.

No work will be accepted after the final class. There is no late work submission for the final project.

Please feel free to set up a meeting if you have any issues. Do not wait until the last minute. 




## Assessment
Your work in this class will be assessed based on the following criteria: Product, Process and Professionalism. Following is a breakdown of grading criteria. Each group accounts for 1/3 of your final grade.

### Product (1/3)
- Appropriateness of the solution as a response to the problem
- Understanding of the user/audience for the problem
- Inventiveness of the solution as a response to the problem
- Craftsmanship and quality of work

### Process (1/3)
- Research (quality & quantity)
- Development of ideas across time (project & semester)
- Translation of problem into unique solution
- Ability to convert research into idea generation
- Ability to communicate ideas and research in visual form
- Improvement of work across the semester

### Professionalism (1/3)
- Attendance
- Verbal and written presentation skills
- Deadlines
- Participation in class critiques
- Preparation and use of time in class

### Scheduling of student course evaluations 
Class time will be set aside toward the end of the semester for completion of student course evaluations. 




## Course Policy
- You are required to bring every handout, file and other course materials to every class meeting. Failure to bring in the supplies that are needed to work in class will result in a whole letter grade reduction for the project. Save everything you produce in class from notes to sketches to video renders.
- You must meet all the deadlines. Loss of digital files/media or malfunction of devices is not a legitimate excuse for late assignments and you will still get a grading penalty. Things will never work the way you would expect. It is part of the design process. Plan ahead. Be flexible.
- Backup your files to external hard drives and cloud-based services. No excuses for losing your files no matter what. Three backups are recommended - local machine, external hard drive and cloud.
- All cell phones must be silenced or turned off, and are not allowed to use during class. No Facebook, instant messaging or irrelevant web surfing allowed.
- Computers must be turned off or in sleep mode during critiques and lectures; students caught messaging, browsing, typing, or otherwise being distracted by the computer during critiques and lectures may be asked to leave.
- We will have a lot of work time in class and this is only for the course-related research and production. Do not work on other class assignments.
- Critiques include yielding constructive feedback to your peers based on aesthetic, conceptual and technical aspects of their work. Students are required to participate in this process, but should be sensitive to the ego and understanding of their peers.
- During demos, remember that students learn at varying rates. Please be patient.
- Above all, have fun. Enjoy the struggles. Learn to deal with frustrations. Embrace the uncertainty. You will grow that much.




## Contact
Set up time during my office hours to talk one on one. You can also email me if you have questions. Expect a delay up to 24 hours in email responses. 




## Attendance
Attendance and participation is mandatory. Arrive on time to the start of each class and after each break. Failure to return from break will be considered as absence. Do not leave class early before it is completely dismissed. *Students who have the equivalent of more than 3 absences are no longer eligible to earn credit for the course.* If you are absent, it is your responsibility for gathering any material missed. I will not recap.

There are no *excused* absences. An absence is an absence. For illness or other causes for extended absences, refer to the MICA's academic policy.

Tardiness is also not tolerated. If you arrive 10 minutes past the scheduled class start time or after returning from break,  this is considered tardy. *3 tardies will be counted as an absence. Arriving more than 30 minutes late will be marked as an absence.*




## Supplies
If there is any required material, it will be discussed ahead of time.

### Required Technologies

## MICA’s Academic Policy statements 

### Americans with Disabilities Act
Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Learning Resource Center at 410-225-2416, in Bunting 458, to establish eligibility and coordinate reasonable accommodations.

### Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)
Students are responsible to follow health and safety guidelines relevant to their individual activities, processes, and to review MICA's Emergency Action Plan and attend EHS training. Students are required to purchase personal protection equipment appropriate for their major or class. Those students who do not have the proper personal protection equipment will not be permitted to attend class until safe measures and personal protection are in place.

### Plagiarism
Each discipline within the arts has specific and appropriate means for students to cite or acknowledge sources and the ideas and material of others used in their own work. Students have the responsibility to become familiar with such processes and to carefully follow their use in developing original work.

### Policy
MICA will not tolerate plagiarism, which is defined as claiming authorship of, or using someone else's ideas or work without proper acknowledgement. Without proper attribution, a student may NOT replicate another's work, paraphrase another's ideas, or appropriate images in a manner that violates the specific rules against plagiarism in the student's department. In addition, students may not submit the same work for credit in more than one course without the explicit approval of all of the instructors of the courses involved.

### Consequences
When an instructor has evidence that a student has plagiarized work submitted for course credit, the instructor will confront the student and impose penalties that may include failing the course. In the case of a serious violation or repeated infractions from the same student, the instructor will report the infractions to the department chair or program director. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the department chair or program director may then report the student to the appropriate dean or provost, who may choose to impose further penalties, including expulsion.

### Appeal Process
Students who are penalized by an instructor or department for committing plagiarism have the right to appeal the charge and penalties that ensue. Within three weeks of institutional action, the student must submit a letter of appeal to the department chairperson or program director, or relevant dean or provost related to the course for which actions were taken. The academic officer will assign three members of the relevant department/division to serve on a review panel. The panel will meet with the student and the instructor of record and will review all relevant and available materials. The panel will determine whether or not to confirm the charge and penalties. The findings of the panel are final. The panel will notify the instructor, the chairperson, division, the student, and the Office of Academic Affairs of their findings and any recommendations for change in penalties.

### Title IX Notification
Maryland Institute College of Art seeks to provide an educational environment based on mutual respect that is free from discrimination and harassment. If you have encountered sexual harassment/misconduct/assault, please know that there are multiple ways to report it and you are encouraged to do so (www.mica.edu/equal_opportunity). Additionally, in order to meet our commitments to equity and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, faculty and staff members are required to report disclosures of sexual violence made to them by students, except when prior notice regarding a specific classroom assignment or discussion is provided. If you require academic accommodations due to an incident involving sexual harassment or discrimination, please contact Student Affairs at 410.225.2422 or Human Resources at 410.225.2363.

### Students with Extended Illness or Cause for Legitimate Absence
In the case of extended illness or other absences that may keep the student from attending a class for more than three meetings, undergraduate students must contact the Student Development Specialist in the Division of Student Affairs. The Student Development Specialist will then work with the student to determine the cause and appropriateness of the absences and subsequently notify instructors as necessary. Graduate students must contact the instructor, program director, and the Office of Graduate Studies. Students in art education or professional studies programs must contact the Dean for the Center for Art Education or the Associate Dean for Open Studies, respectively. The appropriate administrator will facilitate a conversation with relevant faculty to determine whether the student can achieve satisfactory academic progress, which is ultimately at the sole discretion of the faculty member.
