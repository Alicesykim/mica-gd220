You will design a website for an one-day design event. You are the organizer of the event. There will be talks by 3 designers. Choose who you want to invite. There should be a consistency in what they are or what they present. When you have a strong theme and the contents for the event, think about the best way to present them.

The goal for your website is to bring out more interests from people and give useful information about the event to the potential attendees. 

Structure and organize your information clearly using multiple pages. What's the hierarchy like? You cannot predict how the user will navigate your website. How do you want them to use the website? What are the essential information that everyone needs to know? And what are the optional or supplementary info? What would the visitors want to know?

Create an engaging, exciting and memorable website that best represent your event. Ask yourself questions like, how to relate the visuals to the contents? How do you use the design elements such as typography, color, composition, hierarchy to create compelling visuals? How do you keep the consistency to unify different contents using multiple pages? How would the interaction help the experience?

Make sure you are spending enough time to learn different web technologies on your own, and apply them in your project. Do not just show off the design/technical skills. Think about how the design will support the purpose of the website.




## Process
1. Come up with a unique theme for your event. Choose 3 designers you want to invite. Come up with the name of the event.
1. Research on the topic/designers. Collect as many materials as possible.
1. Think about what the contents of the event should be. What would visitors want to know? (ex. location, schedule for each talk, contents of the event, general info on the event, etc.)
1. Think about the structure of the website. *How* do you present it? How clear and easy is it to navigate?
1. Create wireframes for each page with a tool you choose. (ex. Illustrator, InDesign)
1. Create mockups for each page. If there is any state change (ex. hovering), do include them in additional mockups.
1. Design HTML/CSS web pages with a clear hierarchy of information.
1. Get feedbacks and iterate.




## Constraints
- You still have limited technical skills. You will want to challenge yourself with new techniques, but keep the technology as simple and efficient as possible. Plan ahead so you know you can handle it (or not). How would you keep it manageable/doable while maintaining the quality?
- No javascripting. Only HTML and CSS. 
- Interactions should be limited to scrolling, clicking and hovering.
- Base your design on 1200px width mockup.
- Use typefaces from Google Fonts or Adobe Typekit.




## Deliverables
- A zipped folder with HTML/CSS files that are properly linked together.
- Submit both the mockups and the webpages.
- Must include at least 5 pages
- The first webpage must be `index.html`.
