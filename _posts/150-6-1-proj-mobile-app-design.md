For the last project, you will design a mobile app for smartphones. Your app will be about improving an aspect from our daily lives. Define a problem, constraints and audience for the app. What opportunities and limitations do you have for a *mobile* app? Make it useful to your target audience. 

We will focus on processes of interaction design and creating prototypes. Consider the technologies available on smartphones such as camera, sensors(gps, heart rate, brightness, motion, etc), phone, wifi, etc.




## Process
1. Develop an idea that is worth exploring as a mobile app.
1. Research the users and subject with different methods - brand values, competitor analysis, survey, background information, news, articles, etc.
1. Develop wireframes, site maps and navigation systems.
1. Use iterative design process, starting from low-fidelity prototypes with pencil and paper to high fidelity with refined graphic elements.
1. Get feedback from user testing.
