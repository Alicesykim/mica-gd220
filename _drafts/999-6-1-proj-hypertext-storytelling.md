One of the most interesting characteristics of the web is that each document or site are connected by *hyperlinks*. Hypertext allows for non-linear storytelling, meaning that you don’t have to begin at the first page and end at the last page just like a book. Every user’s journey will be different. Some may skip some contents in the middle.

For this project, come up with creative ways of storytelling. The story is about a day in your life. How exciting, dramatic, surreal or boring your day will be like is up to you. Think about things you normally do, things you wish you did, things you would hate to do.

Do not just show off the design/technical skills. Think about how the design will support the story you are telling.

Make sure you are devoting enough time to explore different web technologies on your own, and apply them in your project.

- There must be at least 3 different endings. Provide a link back to the index page for every ending.
