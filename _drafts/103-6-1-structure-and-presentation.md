## Newspaper Analysis Exercise

### 1. Identify different structural/hierarchical elements from a print newspaper. Then, analyze the design decisions such as typography, color, image placement, etc.
- A newspaper is made up of multiple articles. When you think about a structure, you have to think not only about the article's own hierarychy but also the hierarchy of the whole newspaper. 
- How are different elements working under the same system?
- Is any of the visual elements confusing or clear enough to understand?

### 2. Give a structure to every element in plain text news articles. Assign names to each element such as title, caption, etc. to describe each content and its role.
- A system sets rules that will be applied to every element within it. You have to think not only about the today's articles but also the future articles that do not exist yet.
- How would thinking about the structure affect the design decisions?

### 3. What are the differences between print and web in terms of designing a system and user experience?
- What are the similarities and differences?
- How is the user experience different?
- What do you gain or lose by choosing one or the other?

### 4. Look at the original articles and discuss and compare how they structured and presented the information.

### 5. Recreate the same article with HTML and CSS.

## HTML & CSS
HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) are the two main languages of the web.

As you have seen from the exercise above, designing for the web is not so much different in terms of systematic thinking. It is just more explicit in that all the content structure is described with HTML and all the visual presentation is done with CSS.

Most of the time, you will have to go back and forth between HTML tags and CSS rules. Everytime you add an HTML element or CSS rule, think about how it will work within a system.
