we will not just learn html and css. we will have a chance to think about the technologies - how it affects the past, present and future. and how we can use it as a designer.


## What's inside your computer?

- what is computer made up of? (different parts, terminologies): most articles expect you already know these. go to apple website and figure out what specification represents.




## What is it good at?

- using computers to help you being productive and efficient. (shortcuts, what it's good at)

- use computers to help you learn (wikipedia w/grain of salt, google, other softwares and web apps, using forums)

- wikipedia; imaginary animal example(article). use it as a portal for further research. never believe what it says on it. critically evaluate. go to the original sources.

- standards. communications

- what do we lack? when do you think you need something more? how do you think tech can improve your life? as a citizen, as a student, as a designer?



## Code editors
- 


- tools. exchangeable files, etc.
  - organizing folders and files
  - different way of structuring data/information
  - wiki
  - google search engine (how it works)
  - good archiving methods
  - it always needs updating/upgrading/fixing/maintenance (how far do you want to go?)
  - using proprietary vs open tools
  - adversary side effect (forgetting, too much reliance on computer)


- some hands-on exercises



## Discussion Points
  - what is computer good for?
  - what is a danger in using technologies?
  - what do we gain, what do we lose?
  - how do we avoid dystopian future? (broad and close)
  - simulation
  - digital divide; social disparity. how it affects different groups of people. opportunities, quality of life





==========

- using terminal

- some hands-on exercises
  - hacking an image file? 
  - conditional design; design a software (body-syntonic)

- doing your own research (book.google.com, wikipedia.org, google.com, 

- MOOC

- learning facts, thinking critically, retaining information

- machine learning (concepts, examples, current development, art/design context)
